This lab was about reading other people's code, understand it and be able to improve some aspects of it.
As Miquel's project wasn't finished, I'm going to state the changes that that I would do in 
specific functions to improve the program.

First of all I would introduce some sort of error handling in the functions that take user input.
To do so, I would use the (try and except kind of error handling) to accept any input independently
of its case. I would also do that if the program can understant the commant just with the three first characters,
so that if they make a typo the program would still work. 
The key functions where I'd do this are 'Place_troops', 'Place_troops_turn', 'Moving_troops' 
and the soem that aren't done yet like 'Discover' or the combat phase function.

On another note, It would be also nice to introduce the flatten function in order to simplify
the nested lists in the code adn be able to access the elements easier.

Other than that I was really impressed with what he managed to do at the time he did the project,
because the code is nicely organized with the functions on top (some of the pretty complex)
and the a code cell at the end that inicializes the whole sequence, which I think is
the most elegant way to write code.
